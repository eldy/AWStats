# Optionnal setup section (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats adds a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is run as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats frequently enough.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is run from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=1


# If AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to find new lines in your log file to process only new ones,
# so you can launch it as soon as you want, even with this parameter set to 0
# but if you work with this value, you MUST have something to clean sometimes
# your logfile if your web server don't do it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0 	(but if you can, set this to 1 to increase speed)
#
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# MiscTrackerUrl can be used to make AWStats able to detect some miscellaneous
# things, that can not be tracked on other way like:

# - Realplayer G2 plugin
# - QuickTime plugin
# - Mediaplayer plugin
# - Acrobat PDF plugin
# To enable all this features, you must add the following HTML code at the end
# of your index page (before </BODY>) :
# <script language=javascript src="/js/awstats_misc_tracker.js"></script>
# If code is not added in index page, all this detection capabilities will be
# disabled. You must also check that ShowScreenSizeStats and ShowMiscStats
# parameters are set to 1 to make results appear in report page.
# If you change this parameter, you must also change the
# awstatsmisctrackerurl variable into the awstats_misc_tracker.js file.

# Note: If you want to exclude particular URLs from stats (No Pages and no

# DESCRIPTION: Supported charts are built by a 3D graphic applet.
#
#LoadPlugin="graphapplet /awstatsclasses"				# EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE

# PLUGIN: GraphGoogleChartAPI
# REQUIRED MODULES: None
# PARAMETERS: None
# DESCRIPTION: Replaces the standard charts with free Google API generated images 
# in HTML reports. If country data is available and more than one country has hits, 
# a map will be generated using Google Visualizations.
# Note: The machine where reports are displayed must have Internet access for the 
# charts to be generated. The only data sent to Google includes the statistic numbers, 
# legend names and country names.
# Warning: This plugin is not compatible with option BuildReportFormat=xhtml. 
#
#LoadPlugin="graphgooglechartapi"

# PLUGIN: GeoIPfree
# REQUIRED MODULES: Geo::IPfree version 0.2+ (from Graciliano M.P.)
# PARAMETERS: None
# DESCRIPTION: Country chart is built from an Internet IP-Country database.
# This plugin is useless for intranet only log files.
# Note: You must choose between using this plugin (need Perl Geo::IPfree
# module, database is free but not up to date) or the GeoIP plugin (need
# Perl Geo::IP module from Maxmind, database is also free and up to date).
# Note: Activestate provide a corrupted version of Geo::IPfree 0.2 Perl
# module, so install it from elsewhere (from www.cpan.org for example).
# This plugin reduces AWStats speed by up to 10% !

# EXTRA SECTION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WARNING: Extra sections are experimental feature not stable yet !!!

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly usefull for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note that each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 10%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section can result in a too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
