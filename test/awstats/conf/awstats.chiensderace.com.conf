# AWStats configure file
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf and edit this
# new file to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/opt/awstats, /etc/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:
# Parameter="__ENVNAME__"

# MAIN SETUP SECTION (Required to make AWStats working)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "LogFile" contains the web server logfile to analyze.
# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :
#  %YYYY-n  is replaced with 4 digits year we were n hours ago
#  %YY-n    is replaced with 2 digits year we were n hours ago
#  %MM-n    is replaced with month we were n hours ago
#  %DD-n    is replaced with day we were n hours ago
#  %HH-n    is replaced with hour we were n hours ago
#  %WM-n    is replaced with the week number in month (1-5)
#  %DW-n    is replaced with the day number in week (1-7, 1=sunday)
#                              use n=24 if you need (1-7, 1=monday)
#  You can use 0 for n if you need current year, month, day, hour...
# Example: "/var/log/access_log.%YYYY-0%MM-0%DD-0.log"

LogSeparator=" "


# If you want to have information on domains/countries visitors, you must ask
# AWStats to make reverse DNS lookup (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors. Domain/Country chart will also report
# all visitors from a domain/country "Unknown".
# If you need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that reverse DNS lookup
# increase dramatically AWStats update process. Do not use on large web sites.
# Possible values:
#  0 No DNS Lookup
#  1 DNS Lookup is fully enabled
#  2 DNS Lookup is made only from DNS cache file
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=2


# Set this to a directory where you want AWStats to save its working files.
# Need write permissions by web server.
# Example: "../data", "C:/HISTORYDIR", ...
# Default: "." means same directory as awstats.pl
#
DirData="c:\Mes Developpements\awstats\test\benchmark\chiensderace.com"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# Usefull only when AWStats is used from command line.
# Default: "/cgi-bin" means awstats.pl is in "yourwwwroot/cgi-bin"
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin/awstats"


# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" means you must copy icons directories in "yourwwwroot/icon"
#
DirIcons="/icon"


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name or the main intranet web
# server name used to reach the web site.
# This parameter is only used to generate full URLs links when ShowLinksOnUrl
# option is set to 1.
# Example: "www.mydomain.com"
# Example: "user.mydomain.com"
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Default: ""
#
SiteDomain="chiensderace.com"


# Put here all possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/adresses to have the best performances.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "www\.myserver\.com x\.y\.z\.w localhost 127\.0\.0\.1"
#
HostAliases="www.chiensderace.com chiensderaces.com www.chiensderaces.com"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is ran as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is ran from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=1



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the update process run, AWStats can set a lock file in TEMP or TMP
# directory. This lock is to avoid to have 2 update processes running at the
# same time to prevent unknown conflicts problems and avoid DoS attacks when
# AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser is set to 1.
# Because, when you use lock file, you can experience sometimes problems in
# lock file not correctly removed (when process is killed for example that
# require that you remove the file manualy), this option is not enabled by
# default (Do not enable this option with no consol server access).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
EnableLockForUpdate=0


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file to be used
# by your AWStats program called from a browser only if web user has been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=0


# This parameter give the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Example: "__REMOTE_USER__"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers=""

# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it.
# This option can be used by some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a 
# dynamic value for DirData (for example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__") and
# don't want to have to create a new directory each time they add a new user.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0

# In most case, AWStats is used as a cgi program. So AWStats process is ran
# by default web server user (nobody for Unix, IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To make use easier and avoid permission's problems between update process 
# (run by an admin user) and CGI process (ran by a low level user), AWStats
# save its database files with read and write for everyone.
# If you have experience on managing security policies (Web Hosting Provider),
# you should set this parameter to 0. AWStats will keep default process user
# permissions on its files.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=1

# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats is ran.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0

# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0

# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrite the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0

# Index page name for your web server.
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in
#  the DNS. You may specify partial addresses (ie 163.85. for everything
#  behind the usual firewall setup, etc)...
# This is only useful if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "163.85. 201.101.51.2"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""


# Do not include access from clients that match following criteria.
# If your log file contains IP adresses in host field, you must put here
# matching IP adresses criteria.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must put here hostname
# criteria.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "127.0.0.1 163.84. 201.101.51.1"
# Example: "localhost abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""



# Do not include access from clients with a user agent that match following
# criteria. If you want to exclude a robot, you should update the robots.pm
# file instead of this parameter.
# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Example: "konqueror"
# Default: ""
#
SkipUserAgents=""


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can enter a list of not important URLs (like framed menus, hidden pages,
# etc...) to exclude them from statistics. You must enter here exact relative
# URL as found in log file, or a matching REGEX value.
# For example, to ignore /badpage.html, just add "/badpage.html". To ignore
# all pages in a particular directory, add "REGEX[^\/directorytoexclude]".
# The opposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is or not case sensitive
# depending on URLNotCaseSensitive parameter.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/badpage.html REGEX[^\/excludedirectory]"
# Default: ""
#
#SkipFiles="accueil.htm sommaire.htm barre.htm menu.php menu.shtml menu_ onglet classes"
SkipFiles=""


# Include in stats, only accesses to URLs that match one of following entries.
# For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only stats that
# match a particular string, like a particular directory, you can add this
# directory name in this parameter.
# The oposite parameter of "OnlyFiles" is "SkipFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values
# Note: \. means . and xxx$ means URL ending by xxx.
# Example: "marketing_directory"
# Default: ""
#
OnlyFiles=""


# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as
# "Hit only" and not as a "Hit" and "Page viewed". You can set here all images
# extensions as they are hit downloaded that must be counted but they are not
# viewed pages. URL with such extensions are not included in the TOP Pages/URL
# report.
# Note: If you want to exclude your own URLs from stats (No Pages and no Hits
# reported), you should use SkipFiles parameter instead.
# Example: ""
# Example: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp zip arj gz z wav mp3 wma mpg"
# Default: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"
#
NotPageList="css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"

# By default, AWStats considers that records found in web log file are
# successful hits if HTTP code returned by server is a valid HTTP code (200
# and 304). Any other code are reported in HTTP error chart.
# However in some specific environment, with web server HTTP redirection,
# you can choose to also accept other codes.
# Example: "200 304 302 305"
# Default: "200 304"
#
ValidHTTPCodes="200 304"


# By default, AWStats considers that records found in mail log file are
# successful mail transfers if code saved in log file is a valid code (1 for
# sendmail, 0 for postfix).
# Example: "1"
# Example: "0"
# Default: "1"
#
ValidSMTPCodes="1"


# Some web servers on some Operating systems (IIS-Windows) considers that two
# URLs with same value but different case are the same URL. To tell AWStats to
# also considers them as one, set this parameter to 1.
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
# 
URLNotCaseSensitive=0


# In URL links, "?" char is used to add parameters list in URLs. Syntax is:
# /mypage.html?param1=value1&param2=value2
# However, some servers/sites have also others chars to isolate dynamic part of
# their URLs. You can complete this list with this parameter.
# Example: "?;"
# Default: "?"
#
URLQuerySeparators="?;"


# Keep or remove the query string to the URL in the statistics for individual
# pages. This is primarily used to differentiate between the URLs of dynamic
# pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y are counted as two
# different pages.
# Warning, when set to 1, memory required to run AWStats is dramatically
# increased if you have a lot of changing URLs (for example URLs with a random
# id inside). Such web sites should not set this option to 1 or use seriously
# the next parameter URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters.
# Possible values:
# 0 - URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used     (ie: "/mypage.html?p=x&q=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLWithQuery=0


# When URLWithQuery is on, you will get the full URL with all parameters in
# URL reports. But among thoose parameters, sometimes you don't need a
# particular parameter because it does not identify the page or because it's
# a random ID changing for each access even if URL points to same page. In
# such cases, it is higly recommanded to ask AWStats to remove such parameters
# from the URL before counting, manipulating and storing it. Enter here list
# of all non wanted parameters. For example if you enter "id", one hit on
# /mypage.cgi?p=abc&id=Yo4UomP9d and /mypage.cgi?p=abc&id=Mu8fdxl3r
# will be reported as 2 hits on /mypage.cgi?p=abc
# This parameter is not used when URLWithQuery is 0.
# Example: "PHPSESSID"
# Default: ""
# 
URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters=""


# Keep or remove the query string to the referrer URL in the statistics for
# external referrer pages. This is used to differentiate between the URLs of
# dynamic referrer pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y
# are counted as two different referrer pages.
# Possible values:
# 0 - Referrer URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used      (ie: "/mypage.html?p=x&q=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLReferrerWithQuery=0


# AWStats can detect setup problems or show you important informations to have
# a better use. Keep this to 1, except if AWStats says you can change it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
WarningMessages=1

# To help you to detect if your log format is good, AWStats report an error
# if the first NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog lines have all a format that does not
# match the LogFormat parameter.
# However, some worm virus attack on your web server can result in a very high
# number of corrupted lines in your log. So if you experience awstats stop
# because of bad virus records, you can increase this parameter (very rare).
# Default: 50
#
NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog=50

# Search engines keywords reported are full search string or separate keywords
# Possible values:
# 0 - Search keywords reported are full search string (ie: "town maps")
# 1 - Search keywords reported are separated words (ie: "town" and "maps")
# Default: 0
#
SplitSearchString=0

# For some particular integration needs, you may want to have CGI links to
# point to another script than awstats.pl.
# Use the name of this script in WrapperScript parameter.
# Example: "awstatslauncher.pl"
# Default: ""

# EXTRA SECTION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WARNING: Extra sections are experimental feature not stable yet !!!

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly usefull for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note that each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 10%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section can result in a too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
