</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt3">

<div class="CTooltip" id="tt4">
Number of times a <b>page, image, file</b> of the site is <b>viewed</b> or <b>downloaded</b> by someone.<br />

</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt5">

#PROG# recognizes each access to your site after a <b>search</b> from the <b>#SearchEnginesArray# most popular Internet Search Engines and Directories</b> (such as Yahoo, Altavista, Lycos, Google, Voila, etc...).
</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt14">
List of all <b>external pages</b> which were used to link (and enter) to your site (Only the <b>#MaxNbOfRefererShown#</b> most often used external pages are shown).
Links used by the results of the search engines are excluded here because they have already been included on the previous line within this table.
</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt15">
This table shows the list of the most frequent <b>keyphrases or keywords</b> used to find your site from Internet Search Engines and Directories.
(Keywords from the <b>#SearchEnginesArray#</b> most popular Search Engines and Directories are recognized by #PROG#, such as Yahoo, Altavista, Lycos, Google, Voila, etc...).<br />
Note that total number of searches for keywords might be greater than total number of searches for keyphrases (real number of searches) because when 2 keywords were used on same search, search is counted twice for keywords (once for each word).

<div class="CTooltip" id="tt16">
Robots (sometimes refer to Spiders) are <b>automatic computer visitors</b> used by many search engines that scan your web site to index it and rank it, collect statistics on Internet Web sites and/or see if your site is still online.<br />

Here, reported data are: <b>average values</b> (calculated from all data between the first and last visit in analyzed range).

<div class="CTooltip" id="tt19">
Here, reported data are: <b>cumulative sums</b> (calculated from all data between the first and last visit in analyzed range).
</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt20">
Some <b>Visits durations</b> are 'unknown' because they can't always be calculated. This is the major reason for this:<br />
- Visit was not finished when 'update' occured.<br />
- Visit started the last hour (after 23:00) of the last day of a month (A technical reason prevents #PROG# from calculating duration of such sessions)
</div>
<div class="CTooltip" id="tt21">
Worms are <b>automatic computer visitors</b> that are in fact external servers, infected by a virus, that try
to make particular hits on your server to infect it. In most cases, such worms exploit some bugs of not up to date
or commercial servers. If your system is not the <b>sensitive target</b> of the worm, you can simply ignore those hits.<br />
There is very few 'server worms' in the world but they are very active at some times.
#PROG# is able to recognize <b>#WormsArray#</b> known worm's signatures (nimda,code red,...).
