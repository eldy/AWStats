# AWStats configure file 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.myserver.mydomain.conf or awstats.conf and
# edit this new file to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/opt/awstats, /etc/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:
# Parameter="__ENVNAME__"
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAIN SETUP SECTION (Required to make AWStats working)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "LogFile" contains the web server logfile to analyze.
# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
#
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :
#  %YYYY-n  is replaced with 4 digits year we were n hours ago
#  %YY-n    is replaced with 2 digits year we were n hours ago
#  %MM-n    is replaced with month we were n hours ago
#  %DD-n    is replaced with day we were n hours ago
#  %HH-n    is replaced with hour we were n hours ago
#  %WM-n    is replaced with the week number in month (1-5)
#  You can use 0 for n if you need current year, month, day, hour...
# Example: "/var/log/access_log.%YYYY-0%MM-0%DD-0.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex%YY-24%MM-24%DD-24.log"
#
LogFile="/var/log/httpd/mylog.log"

# Put here your log format (Must match your web server config. See setup
# instructions in documentation know how to configure your web server to have
# the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4,5 or "your_own_personalised_log_format"
# 1 = Apache native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 = IIS log format (W3C log format)
# 3 = Webstar native log format
# 4 = Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# 5 = ISA server standard log format
# "your_own_personalised_log_format" = If your log is a personalised format,
#     you must use the following syntax keys to define the log format string:
#     %host             Host client name or IP adress
#     %logname          Authenticated login/user used on protected pages
#     %time1            Date and time with format: [dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss +0000]
#     %time2            Date and time with format: yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss
#     %methodurl        Method and URL with format: "GET /index.html HTTP/x.x"
#     %methodurlnoprot  Method and URL with format: "GET /index.html"

#     %gzipout          Mod_gzip compression output bytes & percentage: Out:num_bytes:%
#     If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use
#     %other            Means another field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Examples for IIS (this two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 2
# LogFormat = "%time2 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd %other %ua %referer"
#
LogFormat=1

# If you want to have informations on domains/countries visitors, you must ask
# AWStats to make reverse DNS lookup (if not already done in your log file).
# If you set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that reverse DNS lookup decrease
# seriously AWStats time processing.
# If you keep DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by the IP addresses
# and not by the full hostname of visitors. Domain/Country chart will also 
# report all visitors from a domain/country "Unknown".
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
# 
DNSLookup=0

# When AWStats updates its statistics, it stores results of its analysis in 
# files (AWStats database). All thoose files are written in the directory
# defined by the "DirData" parameter. Set this value to the directory where
# you want AWStats to save its database and working files into.
# Warning: If you want to be able to use the "AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser"
# feature (see later), you need write permissions by webserver user on this
# directory.
# Example: "/var/cache/awstats"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_data_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="."

# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# This parameter is used only when AWStats is runned from command line
# with -output option (to generate links in HTML reported page).
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/mywwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"

# Relative or absolute web URL of all icons subdirectories.
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="/icon"

# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name or the main intranet web
# server name used to reach the web site.
# This parameter is only used to generate full URLs links when ShowLinksOnUrl
# option is set to 1.
# Example: "www.mysite.com"
# Example: "user.mydomain.com"
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Default: ""
#
SiteDomain=""

# Put here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host aliases
# someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum number of
# possible names/adresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Example: "www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"
#
HostAliases="www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"

# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is runned as a CGI by the web server user
# defined in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX"
# with IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# (awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt) must be writable by this user. Change permissions
# if required.
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is runned from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=0




#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it. This option can be used by
# some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a dynamic value for DirData (for
# example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__").
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0

# In most case, AWStats is used as a cgi program. So AWStats process is runned
# by default web server user (nobody for Unix, IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To avoid permission problems between update process often runned by an admin
# user (root for Unix, Administrator for Windows,...), AWStats save its
# database files by default with read and write for everyone. You can set this
# parameter to 0, if you want AWStats to keep default process user permission.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=1

# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats is runned.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0

# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0

# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrite the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0

# Index page name for your web server.
# Example: "default.htm"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"

# Do not include access from clients that match following criterias.
# If your log file contains IP adresses in host field, you must put here
# matching IP adresses criterias.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must put here hostname
# criterias.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Example: "127.0.0.1 163.84. 201.101.51.1"
# Example: "localhost abcxyz"
# Default: ""
#
SkipHosts=""

# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in
#  the DNS. You may specify partial addresses (ie 163.85. for everything
#  behind the usual firewall setup, etc)...
# This is only useful if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value and put a backslash before each dot.
# Example: "163.85. 201.101.51.2"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""

# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can, with this option, add a list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# For example, to ignore a whole directory tree, just add "directorytoignore",
# to ignore "users" homepage in your stats, you can add "/~".
# The oposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values.
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending with xxx.
# Example: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$ badpage.html /~"
# Default: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"
#
SkipFiles="robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"

# Include in stats, only accesses to URLs that match one of following entries.
# For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only stats that
# match a particular string, like a particular directory, you can add this
# directory name in this parameter.
# The oposite parameter of "OnlyFiles" is "SkipFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values
# Note: xxx$ means URL ending by xxx.
# Example: "marketing_directory"
# Default: ""
#
OnlyFiles=""

# Add here a list of kind of url (file extension) that must be counted as
# "Hit only" and not as a "Hit" and "Page viewed". You can set here all images
# extensions as they are hit downloaded that must be counted but they are not
# viewed pages. URL with such extensions are not included in the TOP Pages/URL
# report.
# Note: If you want to exclude your own URLs from stats (No Pages and no Hits
# reported), you should use SkipFiles parameter instead.
# Example: ""
# Example: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp zip arj gz z wav mp3 wma mpg"
# Default: "css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"
#
NotPageList="css js class gif jpg jpeg png bmp"

# By default, AWStats considers that records found in log file are successfull
# hits if HTTP code returned by server is a valid HTTP code (200 and 304).
# Any other code are reported in HTTP error chart.
# However in some specific environnement, whith web server HTTP redirection,
# you can choose to also accept other codes.
# Example: "200 304 302 305"
# Default: "200 304"
#
ValidHTTPCodes="200 304"

# Keep or attach the query string to the URL in the statistics for individual
# pages. This is primarily used to differentiate between the URLs of dynamic
# pages. If set to 1, mypage.html?id=x and mypage.html?id=y are counted as
# two different pages. Warning, when set to 1, memory required to run AWStats
# is doubled.
# Possible values:
# 0 - URLs are cleaned from the query string (ie: "/mypage.html")
# 1 - Full URL with query string is used     (ie: "/mypage.html?x=y")
# Default: 0
# 
URLWithQuery=0

# AWStats can detect setup problems or show you important informations to have
# a better use. Keep this to 1, except if AWStats says you can change it.
# Possible values: 1 or 0
# Default: 1
#
WarningMessages=1

# To help you to detect if your log format is good, AWStats report an error
# if the first NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog lines have all a format that does not
# match the LogFormat parameter.
# However, some worm virus attack on your web server can result in a very high
# number of corrupted lines in your log. So if you experience awstats stop
# because of bad virus records, you can increase this parameter (very rare).
# Default: 50
#
NbOfLinesForCorruptedLog=50

# Search engines keywords reported are full search string or separate keywords
# Possible values:
# 0 - Search keywords reported are full search string (ie: "town maps")
# 1 - Search keywords reported are separated words (ie: "town" and "maps")
# Default: 0
#
SplitSearchString=0

# You can add in the HTML report page a delay to force browsers to reload page
# if page is loaded a second time after this delay (in seconds).
# Example: 3600
# Default: 0
#
Expires=0
