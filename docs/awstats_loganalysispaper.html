<b>HTML Tag counter</b><br>
<br>

The goal of this way of working is to add a tag on web page, hosted by web site <i>www.mydomain</i>,
that point to a page (may be a CGI script) hosted on a server called <i>tagserver</i> (may be the
same), so that each time a visitor download a page the browser then make a query to server
<i>tagserver</i>. When the server send answer to this tag, it increase a value by one in a database.<br>
<u>What's good:</u><br>
- Easy to do for newbie hosted by free web hosting provider.<br>
- No need to have access to web server log file.<br>
- This is the only way to get some kind of information like <b>screen size</b>, technologies
supported by browsers like <b>Java</b>, <b>Flash</b>, <b>PDF</b> or file format reading capabilities
of visitor computer (<b>Real</b>, <b>QuickTime</b>, or <b>Windows Media</b> files playing capabilities).<br>
<u>What's wrong:</u><br>
- If the browser use a cache or not, the page and counter link can be asked or not by browser
so hit can be counted or not.<br>
- You need to put the tag on each of your page (not only the home page) because a visitor can come
into your site directly to a secondary page with no path on home page. According to web site size, popularity
and content, visits path use the home page between 5% to 95% of times. Adding tags on all pages
can be a very hard work.<br>
- You can't detect robots as a lot of them does not download sub-links detected as CGI counter.<br>
- You miss a lot of informations like keywords, referrers, search engines, ... <br>
- When page is downloaded several times by same user when getting back on previous page, the
referring link can be or not downloaded again.<br>
<u>Summary:</u><br>
Using a counter count something but nothing clear (not visits, nor visitors, nor page views).
Because we don't know what a such tools count it's even not possible to make a study to have an
average error rate for using a such way to get web statistics !<br>
<br>

<b>Log analysis</b><br>
<br>

Because there is so rubbish things that was said and are still said about log analysis, instead of
telling why log analysis can be good, I prefer to tell first all what is said about log analysis
and then tell if it's true or wrong.<br>
You will see that a lot of people speaking about log
analysis (authors of commercial products but also of old free log analyzers) are still living
in a prehistorical time.<br>

...Still in working progress...<br>

<HR noShade SIZE=2>
This section is about what happens when somebody connects to your web site, and 
what statistics you can and can't calculate. There is a lot of confusion about 
this. It's not helped by statistics programs which claim to calculate things 
which cannot really be calculated, only estimated. The simple fact is that 
certain data which we would like to know and which we expect to know are simply 
not available. And the estimates used by other programs are not just a bit off, 
but can be very, very wrong. For example (you'll see why below), <EM>if your 
home page has 10 graphics on, and an AOL user visits it, most programs will 
count that as 11 different visitors!</EM> 
<P>This section is fairly long, but it's worth reading carefully. If you 
understand the basics of how the web works, you will understand what your web 
statistics are really telling you. 
<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>1. The basic model.</B> Let's suppose I visit your web site. I follow a link 
from somewhere else to your front page, read some pages, and then follow one of 
your links out of your site. 
<P>So, what do you know about it? First, I make one request for your front page. 
You know the date and time of the request and which page I asked for (of 
course), and the internet address of my computer (my <I>host</I>). I also 
usually tell you which page referred me to your site, and the make and model of 
my browser. I do not tell you my username or my email address. 
<P>Next, I look at the page (or rather my browser does) to see if it's got any 
graphics on it. If so, and if I've got image loading turned on in my browser, I 
make a separate connection to retrieve each of these graphics. I never log into 
your site: I just make a sequence of requests, one for each new file I want to 
download. The referring page for each of these graphics is your front page. 
Maybe there are 10 graphics on your front page. Then so far I've made 11 
requests to your server. 
<P>After that, I go and visit some of your other pages, making a new request for 
each page and graphic that I want. Finally, I follow a link out of your site. 
You never know about that at all. I just connect to the next site without 
telling you. 



<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>2. Caches.</B> It's not always quite as simple as that. One major problem is 
caching. There are two major types of caching. First, my browser automatically 
caches files when I download them. This means that if I visit them again, the 
next day say, I don't need to download the whole page again. Depending on the 
settings on my browser, I might check with you that the page hasn't changed: in 
that case, you do know about it, and analog will count it as a new request for 
the page. But I might set my browser not to check with you: then I will read the 
page again without you ever knowing about it. 
<P>The other sort of cache is on a larger scale. Almost all ISP's now have their 
own cache. This means that if I try to look at one of your pages and <EM>anyone 
else from the same ISP</EM> has looked at that page recently, the cache will 
have saved it, and will give it out to me without ever telling you about it. 
(This applies whatever my browser settings.) So hundreds of people could read 
your pages, even though you'd only sent it out once. 


<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>3. What you can know.</B> The only things you can know for certain are the 
number of requests made to your server, when they were made, which files were 
asked for, and which host asked you for them. 
<P>You can also know what people told you their browsers were, and what the 
referring pages were. You should be aware, though, that many browsers lie 
deliberately about what sort of browser they are, or even let users configure 
the browser name. Also, a few browsers send incorrect referrers, telling you the 
last page that the user was on even if they weren't referred by that page. And 
some people use "anonymizers" which deliberately send false browsers and 
referrers. 


<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>4. What you can't know.</B> 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><I>You can't tell the identity of your readers</I>. Unless you explicitly 
  require users to provide a password, you don't know who connected or what 
  their email addresses are. 
  <LI><I>You can't tell how many visitors you've had</I>. You can guess by 
  looking at the number of distinct hosts that have requested things from you. 
  Indeed this is what many programs mean when they report "visitors". But this 
  is not always a good estimate for three reasons. First, if users get your 
  pages from a local cache server, you will never know about it. Secondly, 
  sometimes many users appear to connect from the same host: either users from 
  the same company or ISP, or users using the same cache server. Finally, 
  sometimes one user appears to connect from many different hosts. AOL now 
  allocates users a <A 
  href="http://webmaster.info.aol.com/network.html">different hostname for 
  <I>every request</I></A>. So <EM>if your home page has 10 graphics on, and an 
  AOL user visits it, most programs will count that as 11 different 
  visitors!</EM> 
  <LI><I>You can't tell how many visits you've had</I>. Many programs, under 
  pressure from advertisers' organisations, define a "visit" (or "session") as a 
  sequence of requests from the same host until there is a half-hour gap. This 
  is an unsound method for several reasons. First, it assumes that each host 
  corresponds to a separate person and vice versa. This is simply not true in 
  the real world, as discussed in the last paragraph. Secondly, it assumes that 
  there is never a half-hour gap in a genuine visit. This is also untrue. I 
  quite often follow a link out of a site, then step back in my browser and 
  continue with the first site from where I left off. Should it really matter 
  whether I do this 29 or 31 minutes later? Finally, to make the computation 
  tractable, such programs also need to assume that your logfile is in 
  chronological order: it isn't always, and analog will produce the same results 
  however you jumble the lines up. 
  <LI><I>Cookies don't solve these problems</I>. Some sites try to count their 
  visitors by using cookies. This reduces the errors. But it can't solve the 
  problem unless you refuse to let people read your pages who can't or won't 
  take a cookie. And you still have to assume that your visitors will use the 
  same cookie for their next request. 
  <LI><I>You can't follow a person's path through your site</I>. Even if you 
  assume that each person corresponds one-to-one to a host, you don't know their 
  path through your site. It's very common for people to go back to pages 
  they've downloaded before. You never know about these subsequent visits to 
  that page, because their browser has cached them. So you can't track their 
  path through your site accurately. 
  <LI><I>You often can't tell where they entered your site, or where they found 
  out about you from</I>. If they are using a cache server, they will often be 
  able to retrieve your home page from their cache, but not all of the 
  subsequent pages they want to read. Then the first page you know about them 
  requesting will be one in the middle of their true visit. 
  <LI><I>You can't tell how they left your site, or where they went next</I>. 
  They never tell you about their connection to another site, so there's no way 
  for you to know about it. 
  <LI><I>You can't tell how long people spent reading each page</I>. Once again, 
  you can't tell which pages they are reading between successive requests for 
  pages. They might be reading some pages they downloaded earlier. They might 
  have followed a link out of your site, and then come back later. They might 
  have interrupted their reading for a quick game of Minesweeper. You just don't 
  know. 
  <LI><I>You can't tell how long people spent on your site</I>. Apart from the 
  problems in the previous point, there is one other complete show-stopper. 
  Programs which report the time on the site count the time between the first 
  and the last request. But they don't count the time spent on the final page, 
  and this is often the majority of the whole visit. </LI></OL>
<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>5. Real data.</B> Of course, the important question is how much difference 
these theoretical difficulties make. In a recent paper (<CITE>World Wide 
Web</CITE>, <B>2</B>, 29-45 (1999): <A 
href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/projects/uir/pubs/pdf/UIR-R-1999-02-Pirolli-WebJournal-Paths.pdf">PDF 
228kb</A>), Peter Pirolli and James Pitkow of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center 
examined this question using a ten day long logfile from the 
<KBD>xerox.com</KBD> web site. One of their most striking conclusions is that 
different commonly-used methods can give very different results. For example, 
when trying to measure the median length of a visit, they got results from 137 
seconds to 629 seconds, depending exactly what you count as a new visitor or a 
new visit. As they were looking at a fixed logfile, they didn't consider the 
effect of server configuration changes such as refusing caching, which would 
change the results still more. 
<HR noShade SIZE=1>
<B>6. Conclusion.</B> The bottom line is that HTTP is a stateless protocol. That 
means that people don't log in and retrieve several documents: they make a 
separate connection for each file they want. And <EM>a lot of the time they 
don't even behave as if they were logged into one site</EM>. The world is a lot 
messier than this na�ve view implies. That's why analog reports requests, i.e. 
what is going on at your server, which you know, rather than guessing what the 
users are doing. 
<P>Defenders of counting visits etc. claim that these are just small 
approximations. I disagree. For example, almost everyone is now accessing the 
web through a cache. If the proportion of requests retrieved from the cache is 
50% (a not unrealistic figure) then half of the users' requests aren't being 
seen by the servers. 
<P>Other defenders of these methods claim that they're still useful because they 
measure <EM>something</EM> which you can use to compare sites. But this assumes 
that the approximations involved are comparable for different sites, and there's 
no reason to suppose that this is true. Pirolli &amp; Pitkow's results show that 
the figures you get depend very much on how you count them, as well as on your 
server configuration. And even once you've agreed on methodology, different 
users on different sites have different patterns of behaviour, which affect the 
approximations in different ways: for example, Pirolli &amp; Pitkow found 
different characteristics of weekday and weekend users at their site. 
<P>Still other people say that at least the trend over time of these numbers 
tells you something. But even that may not be true, because you may not be 
comparing like with like. Consider what would happen if a large ISP decided to 
change its proxy server configuration. It could substantially change your 
apparent number of visits, even if there was no actual change in the traffic 
levels at your site. 
<P>I've presented a somewhat negative view here, emphasising what you can't find 
out. Web statistics are still informative: it's just important not to slip from 
"this page has received 30,000 requests" to "30,000 people have read this page." 
In some sense these problems are not really new to the web -- they are present 
just as much in print media too. For example, you only know how many magazines 
you've sold, not how many people have read them. In print media we have learnt 
to live with these issues, using the data which are available, and it would be 
better if we did on the web too, rather than making up spurious numbers.

<B>7. Acknowledgements and further reading.</B> Many other people have made 
these points too. While originally writing this section, I benefited from three 
earlier expositions: <CITE><A

Statistics</A></CITE> by Doug Linder; <CITE>Getting Real about Usage 
Statistics</CITE> by Tim Stehle; and <CITE>Making Sense of Web Usage 
Statistics</CITE> by Dana Noonan. (The last two don't seem to be available on 
the web any more.)

<b>Applicative tracking (cookies or session ...)</b><br>
<br>

...Still in working progress...
<br>



<br><br><H1 style="font: 20x arial,helvetica,sanserif">So How AWStats works ?</H1>

<br>
As we have seen previously, there is different ways to get and compute data.
AWStats was built with one goal : Being more accurate than any other tool and use the most
accurate technology to compute its statistics.
That's the reason why AWStats simply uses all thoose methods. The default setup (also called
the 'easy setup for newbies') is only <b>log analysis</b> (enhanced with all clever trips
suggested in this paper to avoid errors made by most log analyzers), but it's highly recommanded
to activate all AWStats feature if you are an experienced user to also use the other
methods (<b>HTML tag counting</b> and <b>Applicative tracking</b>) to benefit of all
advantage of them.<br>
<br>

<u>The conclusion is that :</u><br>
<br>
A log analyzer that does not include a very high level of intelligency in computing log files
will give you very bad results. So most of authors of Commercial Products are wrong when
they  say that a log analysis is a very good way to have statistics. IT IS, BUT ONLY
if the product uses complex rules to reduce errors, and that's not the case for
their product (I study 2 of them, among the two most popular, and both of them were so
simple in their "algorithm" that the error rate was between 40% to 250%.
A log analysis is more than just counting lines in a file !).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, people that say a log analyzer can't give accurate results are also
wrong, because when saying that, THEY FORGET THERE IS NOWDAYS NEW TECHNICS (like thoose developped
in AWStats) TO EXCLUDE OR REDUCE SERIOUSLY CACHE BROWSERS, PROXY, IP LOCATION, WORMS, ROBOTS
AND LOG WRITING BUFFERING PROBLEMS. Of course using thoose technics consumes a lot of
time and reduces log analyzer speed by 2 or 3, but this give you very precise results.<br>
