- Fix failing call to ipv6 plugin.
- Pb with some regex value used in the new REGEX fields added in 5.6.
- Better support for WebStar log files.
- Count for add to favourites is done on hits to favicon.ico for IE only. This
  avoid counting wrong "Add" done by browsers that hit the file even when no
  add is done. Value reported is the (count for IE) / (ratio of IE among all
  other browsers).
- Count for Browsers with WMA audio playing support now works.

  included in config file.

  DNSLookup is enabled and successfull. This increase seriously AWStats speed
  when DNSLookup and Geoip are both enabled.
- Chars < and > inside reported values are no more removed but coded with &lt;
  and &gt; in html built page.

New features/improvements:
- Added 'rawlog' plugin to add a form to show raw log content with filter
  capabilities.

  session.

  SkipDNSLookupFor, ...)
- StyleSheet parameter works completely now and sample of CSS files are
  provided.
- Add meta tags robots noindex,nofollow to avoid indexing of stats pages by
  compliant robots.
- Added a "Miscellanous chart" to report ratio of Browsers that support:
  Java, Flash, Real reader, Quicktime reader, WMA reader, PDF reader.
- "Miscellanous chart" also report the "Add to favourites" (must remove the
  "robots.txt" and "favicon.ico" entries off your SkipFiles parameter in your
  config file to have this feature working.
- Update process now try a direct access at last updated record when a new
  update is ran. If it fails (file changed or wrong checksum of record), then
  it does a scan from the beginning of file until a new date has been
  reached (This was the only way of working on older version). So now update
  process is very much faster for those who don't purge/rotate their log
  file between two update process (direct access is faster than full scan).
- Better look for report pages on Netscape/Mozilla browsers.

Other/Documentation:
- Updated documentation.
- Update wap/imode browser list.

  not found' URLs are kept with parameters only if URLReferrerWithQuery is set
  to 1. This make this report more useful.

  supporting bugged and non standard MS products. Sorry but this takes me too

  tool to convert into a W3C log file.
