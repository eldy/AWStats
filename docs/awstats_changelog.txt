$Revision$ - $Author$ - $Date$ 


5.6

Fixes:
- Domain with no pages hits were always reported as other in domain chart.
- percent for other in full list of "links for internet search engines"
  has been fixed.

New features/improvments:
- Report compression ratios with mod_deflate feature (Apache 2).
- A better browser detection.
- Can add regex values for a lot of list parameters (HostAliases,
  SkipDNSLookupFor, ...)
- StyleSheet parameter works completely now and sample of CSS files are
  provided.
- Add meta tags robots noindex,nofollow to avoid indexing of stats pages by
  compliant robots.
- Added a "Miscellanous chart" to report ratio of Browsers that support:
  Java, Flash, Real reader, Quicktime reader, WMA reader, PDF reader.

  "robots.txt" and "favicon.ico" entries off your SkipFiles parameter in your
  config file to have this feature working.

Other/Documentation:
- Updated documentation.

5.5

Fixes:
- Summary robots list was limited to MaxNbOfLoginShown instead of being
  limited to MaxNbOfRobotShown value.
- Fixed a bug when using HBL codes in ShowRobotsStats parameter.
- AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers now works for users with
  space in name.
- Bug 730996. When URLWithQueryWithoutFollowingParameters was used with a
  value and another parameter was ended with this value, the wrong parameter
  was truncated from URL.

New features/improvments:
- Added a 'Screen Size' report.
- Group OS by families. Added a detailed OS version chart.
- Better 404 errors management. URLs are always cleaned from their parameter
  to build '404 not found' URLs list (because parameters are not interesting
  as they can't have effect as page is not found). Referrer URLs list for '404
  not found' URLs are kept with parameters only if URLReferrerWithQuery is set
  to 1. This make this report more useful.
- Added 'geoipfree' plugin (same than 'geoip' plugin but using the free
  Perl module Geo::IPfree).
- 'geoip' plugin can works with Perl module Geo::IP but also with Perl module
  Geo::IP::PurePerl).
- Added 'userinfo' plugin to add information from a text file (like lastname,
  office department,...) in authenticated user chart.
- month parameter can accept format -month=D, not only -month=DD
- Optimized code size.
- Optimized HTML output report size.
- Added plugin ipv6 to fully support IPv6 (included reverse DNS lookup).
- Split month summary chart and days of month chart in two different charts in
  main page. This also means that ShowDaysOfMonthStats and
  AddDataArrayShowDaysOfMonthStats parameters were added.
- Added -staticlinksext to build static pages with another extension than
  default .html
- Added QMail support and better working support for Postfix and Sendmail (SMA
  preprocessor was replaced by maillogconv.pl).

Other/Documentation:
- AWStats default install directory is /usr/local/awstats for unix like OS.
- Added Isle of Man, Monserat, and Palestinian flag icon.
- Added "local network host" and "Satellite access host" in label of possible
  countries and icons (They appears when using geoip plugins).
- Better management of parsed lines counting. The last line number is also
  stored in history file, for a future use.
- Removed LogFormat=5 option for ISA log file because I am fed up of
  supporting bugged and non standard MS products. Sorry but this takes me too
  many times. To use AWStats with an ISA server, just use now a preprocessor
  tool to convert into a W3C log file.
- Added estonian, serban and icelandic language files.
- Updated documentation.
